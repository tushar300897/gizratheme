-- What is this file? --

This is a readme file. It is helpful to have a readme file that provides basic
information about the project, and necessary instructions for installation and
configuration. It can be a txt or md file, but should always be plain-text so it
is easily read on any computer.


-- Installation --

1.Download Bootstrap 3 from given link:"https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap".
  To install Bootstrap  , place its folder in the [Drupal root]/themes folder, or a
  themes folder inside your site's directory. The themes directory can also be
  organized into sub-folders. Drupal will recursively search through the folders.

2.To install Girza, place its folder in the [Drupal root]/themes folder, or a
themes folder inside your site's directory. The themes directory can also be
organized into sub-folders. Drupal will recursively search through the folders.

All of the following are valid:

themes/girza
themes/contrib/girza
sites/default/themes/girza
sites/mysite/themes/girza
sites/mysite/themes/custom/girza


After Girza is placed in the right location, visit the Appearance page. This
page lists all the themes available for installation or already installed.
Locate Girza in the list and click the "Install and set as default" link.
This will install Girza and set it as the default theme. When you visit the
frontend of your site (not an admin page) you will see it active.



*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
* After adding a new theme in Drupal 8, you'll need to clear the theme registry's
cache, which you can do by clearing all cache in the UI or running `drush cr` ,
if you have Drush installed.
